ABOUT

This is a few python console apps.

midiroute.py - Act as a midi router and console app interface to
  yoshimi, or possibly useful to interface to other synth.  Prototype-ish
  BETA script program.

lscp_pick.py - Act as console tool to load SFZ files into linuxsampler to
 quickly test/sample many SFZ sound sample files.

Available currently in:
  git clone https://githib.com/kbongos/tar-pit.git

INSTALL

For midiroute/py you will need to compile and install the alsaseq lib included.
cd alsaseq; python setup.py build; sudo python setup.py install
alsaseq lib I find here: pp.com.mx/python/alsaseq
Mine here has some modifications to help show/pick MIDI ins/outs and
a few other things.
then run inplace like:
./midiroute.py  or try:
python ./midiroute.py

For lscp_pick.py it uses a copy of lscp python library in sub-dir included.
Should just work assuming you have linuxsampler available.
run inplace like:
./lscp_pick.py  or try:
python ./lscp_pick.py

Use of lscp_pick.py - 

This will allow generation of a list of sfz files, and quick loading
based on numeric entry of sfz files into linuxsampler.  It is assumed
linuxsampler is running(run it in some other window, or in background prior).
Jack operation is assumed, so that should be running first.

It may ask to create a midi input, and a JACK audio output if one is not
setup yet in linuxsampler.  You need to connect these with something like
qjackctl.  Then enter sfz_scan command, and enter a directory to recursively
scan for .sfz files.  It will save this in a sfz_list.out file and load
it on start.  It uses this as a sfz numbered file list.  Enter sfz_load
command and it will prompt for the number of the sfz file to load.  It
may be needed to load this sfz_list.out file in a text editor for a
reference of the numbers and filenames.  It will continue to prompt for
quick entry and cycling thru numerous sfz files to sample or test.
It is assumed that an external keyboard is used to play/test the loaded
sfz files.  Channel 1 midi is assumed and used.

Some provision is made to embed a list of sfz files in the script if this
is useful(it will be used if sfz_list.out does not exist).

This lscp python lib is from(in development, so mine here maybe stale):
  git clone http://chrisarndt.de/git/lscp.git
