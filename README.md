# tar-pit
My first repo on github, please ignore, move along folks.  Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.

The tar-pit is a sandbox to learn github, get my brain familiar with git again.
Ugh, git.  I will be using this tar-pit mainly as a test bed.

The midrt dir is some proto code for midi routing.
It includes a modified alsaseq lib.

Mainly want to do a bunch of changes on some code I don't care much about
to get familiar with git.  Ugh.
