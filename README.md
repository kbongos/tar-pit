# tar-pit

This is my sandbox with some python scripts.  I called it tar-pit
for fun.  Once I get more comfortable with git, or get to the point
where the contents are better defined, I may move these
into something other than the tar-pit.

midrt/midiroute.py - Act as a midi router and console app interface to
 yoshimi, or possibly useful to interface to other synth.  Prototype-ish
 BETA script program.

midrt/lscp_pick.py - Act as console tool to load SFZ files into linuxsampler
 to quickly test/sample many SFZ sound sample files.  Scan for sfz files and
 make a list.

This includes a modified alsaseq lib for midiroute.py, and a
copy of lscp python lib for lscp_pick.py.
